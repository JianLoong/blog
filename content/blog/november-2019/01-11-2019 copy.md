{{% notice note %}}

When using Google Firestore, there is a need to put some thought into the way the data is structure. Each option would have an advantage or limitations **depending on the use case.**

{{% /notice %}}

With JSON being everywhere, there are times when there is a need to figure out how to structure data in the Cloud Firestore.

Here are a few common options.
 
 - Nested data in documents
 - Subcollections
 - Root-level 
 
{{% notice warning %}}

The most important thing to remember that there is **no perfect** solution for structuring a Cloud Firestore database. The best and correct solution often times would be the solution that fis the needs and makes the job easier.

{{% /notice %}}

| Type | Advantages | Limitations|
|:------:|:--------------|:-----------------------|
|Nested | Easy to set up | Nested documents isn't as scalable as other |
