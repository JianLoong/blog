<p align="center"><strong>I am Jian.</strong></p> 
<p align="center">Welcome to my blog!</p>

For the past 2.5 years, I have been working as a Teaching Associate with Monash University. I have taught both at the undergraduate level as well as postgraduate level. Overall, I have assisted over 100 students every semester to understand the course material and taught them how to apply critical thinking to every aspect of their studies.

It is my personal belief that, it is more important for a student to understand the underlying concepts before approaching a problem. Understanding how to solve a problem takes precedence over making the same mistakes over and over again just to see what will work.
