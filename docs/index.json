I do not want to solve the problem for them. In actual fact, I want to teach them a useful skill where they could arrive to the solution by understanding the problem, thus they would be able to solve the problem with my help but not with me outright giving the answer.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s an old saying\u0026hellip;.\nGive a man a fish, and you'll feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you've fed him for a ife time. - Confucius  Of course, I would save a lot of time by just giving out the solution, but will that be useful for the student in the long term?\nMost students generally have more time at hand than the teaching staff, however most of the times, teaching associates (TA)s find it frustrating when handling and teaching students how to solve a problem due to their own schedules as well. It is my belief that, it is very important to teach students the correct process of debugging and problem solving in this scenario.\nI totally disagree with my co-worker that I should outright give them the solution for their programming issue. However, I think it would also depends on the personality and the method of teaching each individual would have. I think the depth of understanding plays a very important role when attempting to do rubber duck debugging. That very individual does not have much of a programming background but more towards a business background thus the mind set is completely different. I am not trying to victimise that person, however it is merely different point of views.\nWhat is Rubber Duck Debugging? Rubber ducking is a very useful technique for finding the cause of a problem by explaining it someone else.

In Linux distributions, the directory structure is defined by the Filesystem hierarchy Standard.1\n .secondLevel  rect { fill:lightblue !important; }  graph TD R( / ) L1A( /bin ) L1AA( /etc ) L1B( /proc ) L1C[ /boot ] L1D[ /root ] L1E[ /dev ] L1F( /home ) L1G( /usr ) L2A( /jian ) L2B( /tim ) L2C( /kevin ) L2D( /bin ) R -- L1A R -- L1AA R -- L1B R -- L1C R -- L1D R -- L1E R -- L1F R -- L1G L1F -- L2A L1F -- L2B L1F -- L2C L1G -- L2D style R fill:#FFFFFF class L1A,L1AA,L1B,L1C,L1D,L1E,L1F,L1G secondLevel;  This diagram shows how the file system looks like on an Ubuntu machine. The first and top most directory is called the root directory. This directory is denoted as the / (forward slash) symbol. The reason for this is because it can be thought off as the trunk of a tree. The directory entry itself has no name. The name of it is the empty part before the initial directory separator.\n   Directory Purpose     / - First directory and the root of the entire file system hierarchy - Contains all other directories   /bin - Contains commands that may be used by both the system administrators and by users - There must be no subdirectories in here.   /boot - The operating system kernel is located here.   /etc - Contains configuration files. Configuration file is a local file that is used to control the operation of a program. It must be static and cannot be an executable binary.   /home - This directory contains user\u0026rsquo;s home directories. Generally, each user would have a separate directory with their username under this directory.    Even though /home is a standard concept, the setup will differ from host to host. Therefore it is important that no program should assume any specific location for a home directory, rather it should query for it.\n On Ubuntu, you will notice another directory called /root, however, this is not the root directory. It is actually the home directory of the superuser.\n Your home directory. What is a pathname? There are two types of path names.\ngraph TD linkStyle default interpolate linear R(Pathname) P1(Absolute Path) P2(Relative Path) R -- P1 R -- P2 style P1 fill:skyblue; style P2 fill:skyblue;  The man pages There are several ways in which users obtain help. One of the most well known way would be to use the man pages. However, these days most people do not use the man pages anymore.\n$ man For example, if you want to take a look at the man pages for the ls command, you will just need to do\n$ man ls The ls command List in long format all the files and directories in your home directory.\nAnswer\n$ ls -l The main challenge of this question is so that students understand how to use the ls command.\nThere are several points to take note in this question. For example, what is the meaning of long format? What does it mean by all files and directories?\nOne interesting thing is that most people do not know that the ls command can actually be given a file.\nSo, the various accepted answers for this question are\n$ ls -l $ ls --all -l $ ls -al List in long format all the files and directories (top-level only) in the /usr/local directory, sorted by the time of last modification.\n$ ls -lt /usr/local One interesting thing about Ubuntu is the way it manages time.

These are also called state charts at times, as we often use terms interchangeably. The semantical difference between two of these diagrams are miniscule at best.\nstateDiagram [*] -- Open Open -- Closed Closed -- [*]  A simple initial state chart for the state of a door.\nIn fact, for most people, UML is perceived to be something that is not very useful in the development world. The main reason, is because the lack of understanding how the diagrams would relate to a real world application. When I first learn about UML state machines, I often confuse it with other diagrams like the flow chart as well as the activity diagram. I would also question its usefulness. Over time, I realised that it is the most useful diagrams in UML. I would rank it second in terms of importance, the first spot being the class diagram itself.\nI will attempt to explain why in this blog post.\nRemember that at the end of the day, diagrams are very useful to gain a better understanding of the system. As the saying goes, a picture tells a thousand words. The very first thing to understand is that a state chart is a dynamic modelling technique. It focuses on identifying the behavior of your system, specific to instances of a single class. 1\nThe main keywords here are\n A Single Class Dynamic  Let\u0026rsquo;s try to understand these keywords in more details.\nA single class The key features of a state machine, is that it used to model a specific instance of a single class. This concept is at utmost importance when dealing with state diagrams. Not two classes, not three classes but a single class. Before we move on, lets see an example of a class diagram for now. Remember that normally the construction of a state diagram happens after the class diagram.\ngraph LR A[Student] B[Unit] A -- B  A simple class diagram. (Initial level)\nThe example above is a simplification of what a class diagram is at its very basic nature. Two classes, Student and Unit and the Student class using the Unit class.\npublic class Student { private String firstName; private String lastName; private Unit unit; // Other methods omitted.. }public class Unit { private String name; private String description; // Other methods omitted.. } So, where does the state machine come into the picture in this situation? Since the state machine diagram aims to model a single class. Which class would we model here? Do we model both of them or just one? The answer is pretty simple, we actually attempt to do a state chart of all of the classes.\nSince based on the diagram, the Student class is using the Unit class, we should start modelling the state chart from the Unit class. The very first steps when drawing the state machine diagram would be to list out all the possible states.\nRemember that the objective of modelling is always to understand the system in more detailed view. We would also like to understand requirements better. This can be achieved in real life by talking to the real clients and users. If it is a fictional scenario, assumptions would then be made.\n The more intellectually stimulating steps is probably where you list out the possible states in a state chart.\nSo, lets say the possible states of a Unit are\n Offered Not offered  stateDiagram [*] -- Offered Offered -- NotOffered NotOffered -- [*]  However, if you continue the thought process, there are probably more states which can only be derived by understanding the requirements further.\nFor example, if we apply the concept of 4W1H, we will attempt to understand more regarding the requirements itself.\n   Category Question     Who ?   Where ?   When ?   How ?    Dynamic One of the biggest difference regarding state diagrams in comparison to the other diagrams in UML is that it attempts to model the dynamic nature of a system. In comparison to the other diagrams, state machine diagrams can model something which is not captured by the class diagram, as well as the use case diagram.\nIt is very important to understand that over time, the state of a class changes. In the semantical sense, dynamic conveys the meaning of (of a process or system) characterised by constant change, activity, or progress.\nstateDiagram [*] -- Offered Offered -- NotOffered NotOffered -- [*]  So, if we take a look at our current state chart, what we would like to know is, how does it shift from one state into another state.\nDiagrams P.S. - The real reason I wanted to make to blog post, is actually just to use mermaid diagrams.\nReferences 1.

In a one liner the TSP asks the following question: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of the cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?\u0026rdquo;\nThe conditions in this scenario are that no point can be visited twice and it must return to the starting point. The selected starting point here is New York. (The starting point does not really matter in this scenario.). There are times however, that a point maybe the revisited more than once in order to achieve a better solution. The number of cities in this scenario is 13. In this specific implementation, it will never visit the same city twice.\nThe inspiration for this post is based on the google OR-Tools found here. This blog post, however uses Genetic Algorithm to obtain the answer. It is implemented with a web worker which runs in the browser based on JavaScript.\nI will also reuse the genetic algorithm implementation written for another blog post however with different fitness functions and different cross-over methodologies.\n   Location Coordinates Shorthand     New York 40, -74 A   Los Angeles 34, -118 B   Chicago 41, -87 C   Minneapolis 44, -93 D   Denver 39, -104 E   Dallas 32,-96 F   Seattle 47,-122 G   Boston 42,-71 H   San Francisco 37,-122 I   St. Louis 38,-90 J   Houston 29,-95 K   Phoenix 33,-111 L   Salt Lake City 40,-111 M    Total number of cities - 13.\nIn order to the Genetic Algorithm to work, a distance matrix needs to be given to it. This distance matrix is based on the \u0026ldquo;Euclidean Distance\u0026rdquo; and not Road Network distance. The distance matrix is obtained from here which has 13 cities in the United States.\nThe Genetic Algorithm Solution  Cross Over Method Ordered PMX    Selection Method Tournament Random Rank Roulette Wheel   Please click run to see the results based on different cross over and selection methods. \nRun It can be observed that the selection method random tends to not give a good result as it would defeat the purpose of the GA algorithm. The current mutation rate of the GA is set to 0.2 for this purpose. The starting population size is set to 20. Due to the nature of GA, each run under the given settings will give a different solution as I have defaulted the number of generations to 500. This includes running with the same cross over methodology and selection methodology.\n        The fitness in general would depend on the cross over methodology. For example, if the roulette wheel methodology is used, it can be observed that the average fitness tends to spike more. The suggested answer based on the Google OR tools is New York - Boston - Chicago - Minneapolis - Denver - Salt Lake City - Seattle - San Francisco - Los Angeles - Phoenix - Houston - Dallas - St Louis - New York which gives the total distance of 7293 miles which is also the minimal tour length.\nThe GA however does not obtain this solution. It does however, generate a high quality solution really quick.\n        Lessons from this post  The earth is not flat! Mapping putting coordinates using latitude and longitude on a chart, it would work in a different way so it displays beautifully. Latitude and longitude needs to be swapped.\n Most chart API do not let you specify both the x-axis and y-axis at the same time. This is especially true if the chart is able to generate SVG diagrams. SVG diagrams are always nicer and would generally be of more responsive nature at the end of the day.\n You can use a series graph to draw lines from a point to point in the chartist API. However, chartist API does not like the situation where there are two values on the same axis. (So it is not able to draw a straight line on the x-axis because of the nature of a series chart. An example of this is where there is a point on 30,55 and 30,65.\n There are specific data sets in which people benchmark their TSP solutions.\n The GA will downgrade into a random search if the mutation rate is too high.

The official reference can be found here. This assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of how promises work.\n Before we start, there is a need to understand how certain RESTful services are structured. For example, the Hacker News API has the end point called topstories. This end point however, does not contain any other information besides a list of item IDs. So, if you would like to obtain the top 10 post including their title, there would be a need to do several GET request to fetch them all.\nThe code example below would demonstrate a situation where the Promise.all becomes useful.\nconst getTopStoriesId = () =\u0026gt; { let endPoint = \u0026#34;https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json\u0026#34;; return fetch(endPoint, { mode: \u0026#34;cors\u0026#34; }).then((response) =\u0026gt; response.json()); }; const getItem = (itemNumber) =\u0026gt; { let endPoint = \u0026#34;//hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/\u0026#34; + itemNumber + \u0026#34;.json\u0026#34;; return fetch(endPoint, { mode: \u0026#34;cors\u0026#34; }).then((response) =\u0026gt; response.json()); } const topStories = () =\u0026gt; getTopStoriesId().then((result) =\u0026gt; { let promiseArray = []; result.forEach((element) =\u0026gt; { promiseArray.push(getItem(element)); }); return Promise.all(promiseArray); });  Code Example of the Promise.all Flowchart Representation graph TD S(Start) A(Fetch from /topstories) B{Valid?} C(Parse all IDs from /topstories) D(Create multiple Promises with Fetch using the /items/id end point based on the IDs obtained) E(Create the Promise.all) F{Valid?} G(Results) Y(Report Error) Z(End) S--A A--B B-- Valid Response --C B-- Invalid Response --Y C--D D--E E--F F-- Invalid Response --Y F-- Valid Response --G Y--Z G--Z  Fig 1. Flow Chart of the Promise.all Lessons from this blog post.  The then function returns a promise as well. Fetch is significantly easier to use in comparison to its jQuery counterparts. However, considerations needs to be taken into account when using it in static sites that does not have Babel or modernizr. There are a lot of reasons a lot of users decided to create their own wrappers around the Hacker News API. Perhaps, it is deemed that their top stories and end up which does summary could be done in a different way. But HN itself is a very opinionated community. Mermaid diagrams are useful and break tags can be introduced in them. CORS and JSONP exist. Cors is more modern and easier to use compared to using JSONP. Using jQuery can make the codes very unreadable and creating call back hell easier.

This post will explain how to accomplish an easy nearest neighbour query.\n We will first start with a data set or coordinates.\n\nThe Nearest Neighbour Query on the map aims to return the nearest neighbour of a point. So, in the example, it can be seen that the 1st Nearest Neighbour of New York would be Boston and the 2nd Nearest Neighbour of New York Would be Chicago. This goes on for the k value. The interesting thing to remember is that the starting point of the query often times do not start from the set of existing points.\nWhat if we would like to query 20 nearest neighbour from a query point? This solution can easily be answered with a naive linear query if we do not have an existing data structure. Basically we can just calculate the distance from each point (each city) to our location to determine which ones are the nearest 20 points to us.\nHowever, in bigger applications where there would be more points (Think 1 million points), data structures like the R-tree would play a very important role to perform such queries. At the end of the day, it is important to understand that algorithms operate on data structures.\nThe naive solution would be to do something as follows. (Written in JavaScript)\nconst sortPointsBasedOnDistance = (queryPoint, points) =\u0026gt; { points.sort((pointA, pointB) =\u0026gt; { return ( calculateDistance(queryPoint, pointA) - calculateDistance(queryPoint, pointB) ); }); }; const calculateDistance = (startingPoint, endingPoint) =\u0026gt; { let x = endingPoint.x - startingPoint.x; let y = endingPoint.y - startingPoint.y; return Math.hypot(x, y); }; const createPoint = (name, x, y) =\u0026gt; ({ name: name, x: x, y: y }); let points = []; points.push( createPoint(\u0026#34;New York\u0026#34;, 40, -74), createPoint(\u0026#34;Chicago\u0026#34;, 41, -87), createPoint(\u0026#34;Minneapolis\u0026#34;, 44, -93), createPoint(\u0026#34;Boston\u0026#34;, 42, -71), createPoint(\u0026#34;Denver\u0026#34;, 39, 104), createPoint(\u0026#34;Dallas\u0026#34;, 32, -96) ); let queryPoint = createPoint(\u0026#34;Query Point\u0026#34;, 40, -74); sortPointsBasedOnDistance(queryPoint, points); console.log(points);  Lessons from this blog post.  It is hard to explain a year longs\u0026rsquo; research in a single blog post. Console.log in JavaScript is passed a reference to the object, thus the value will actually change when the object changes. It is not the value of he object at the moment in time where you call console.log. There are not many existing libraries written in JavaScript that deals with these specialised queries. (Perhaps more investigation is needed) The sort function in JavaScript is an ES6 feature, careful consideration needs to be taken into account when using it and also be careful with the curly bracers and no curly bracers. Creating an object requires brackets \u0026ldquo;(\u0026rdquo; wrapped around \u0026ldquo;{\u0026rdquo; parenthesis.   const sortPointsBasedOnDistance = (queryPoint, points) = { points.sort((pointA, pointB) = calculateDistance(queryPoint, pointA) - calculateDistance(queryPoint, pointB) ) } const calculateDistance = (startingPoint, endingPoint) = { let x = endingPoint.x - startingPoint.x; let y = endingPoint.y - startingPoint.y; return Math.hypot(x, y); } const createPoint = (name, x,y) = ({ name: name, x: x, y: y }); let points = []; points.push( createPoint(\"New York\",40,-74), createPoint(\"Chicago\",41,-87), createPoint(\"Minneapolis\", 44,-93), createPoint(\"Boston\", 42,-71), createPoint(\"Denver\", 39, 104), createPoint(\"Dallas\", 32, -96) ); let queryPoint = createPoint(\"Query Point\",40, -74); sortPointsBasedOnDistance(queryPoint, points); console.log(points);  "},{"uri":"https://jianliew.me/blog/","title":"Contents","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Hello!
