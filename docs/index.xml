Grammar of a Guard Statement
guard-statement &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; guard condition-list else code-block
This was a conversation I had with a co-worker a couple of days back. I asked him, what is this guard in Swift? I have not been programming in Swift since iOS development made a shift from Objective C to Swift and I have not seen a guard statement used in any other languages I programmed in.</description></item><item><title>Nested Data in Documents (FireStore)</title><link>https://jianliew.me/blog/entries/2019-11/firestore/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jianliew.me/blog/entries/2019-11/firestore/</guid><description>Introduction When using Google Firestore, there is a need to put some thought into the way the data is structure. Each option would have an advantage or limitations depending on the use case.
With JSON being everywhere, there are times when there is a need to figure out how to structure data in the Cloud Firestore.
Here are a few common options.
Nested data in documents Subcollections Root-level The most important thing to remember that there is no perfect solution for structuring a Cloud Firestore database.</description></item><item><title>Singleton &amp; Observer Pattern (Java)</title><link>https://jianliew.me/blog/entries/2019-11/singletonobserverpattern/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://jianliew.me/blog/entries/2019-11/singletonobserverpattern/</guid><description>This blog post will demonstrate a simple use case where the singleton and observable design pattern becomes important.
Let's imagine if you are in the arcade and there is a Lucky Dip Machine. The reason I like call it the LuckyDipMachine is because it is one of the feature assignments in the Programming Foundation Units in Monash University and it is often times made fun at. However, the solution for assignment itself can be engineered to be better.</description></item><item><title>JavaScript Sort Stability</title><link>https://jianliew.me/blog/entries/2019-11/javascriptsort/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://jianliew.me/blog/entries/2019-11/javascriptsort/</guid><description>Sorting is important. Sorting in JavaScript can be quirky. This blog post will be regarding a recent post made by the v8 team regarding the Array.prototype.sort.
This blog post will demonstrate an example where the stability of a sort becomes important. This situation is normally known as the two-pass sorting, which is a technique commonly used sort two columns. In other words, I would like to use one function to sort one column first and then another function to sort another column.</description></item><item><title>Min and Max value of an Array (Java)</title><link>https://jianliew.me/blog/entries/2019-11/minmax/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://jianliew.me/blog/entries/2019-11/minmax/</guid><description>There are many ways to obtain the min and maximum value of items inside of an Array. This blog post will show case its many ways.
The most basic way to do this is to loop through the entire array manually. The benefit of doing it this way, is that it just relies on the standard library and can be easily rewritten to an even simpler form. This way uses the Math.</description></item><item><title>Programming to an Interface (Java)</title><link>https://jianliew.me/blog/entries/2019-11/programmingtoaninterface/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://jianliew.me/blog/entries/2019-11/programmingtoaninterface/</guid><description>Introduction A question that often arises is, what is the benefit of programming to an interface? This blog post will attempt to explain why. It is quite common for people to have heard of the term but do not really understand the significance of it.
The Fallacy It is important to understand that the interface word used here is actually the broader concept of what an interface is, it does not mean the Java Interface.</description></item><item><title>Foreign Key Constraint</title><link>https://jianliew.me/blog/entries/2019-11/foreignkeys/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://jianliew.me/blog/entries/2019-11/foreignkeys/</guid><description>Introduction The motivation for this blog entry is the following post on Hacker News titled &amp;ldquo;Thoughts on Foreign Key&amp;rdquo;. Link here
In the post, it is mentioned that &amp;ldquo;At GitHub we do not use foreign keys, ever, anywhere.&amp;quot;. This post is actually made by Shlomi Noach, who a principal Software Engineer at Github.

AFINN is a list of words rated for valence rated with an integer between minus five(negative) and plus five (positive). This implementation uses AFINN-en-165. 1
This approach however is a very naive approach as it does not build any models to determine the context of the usage of the word itself.

Here, you would start with a random string and end up with the target string.
This post is heavily inspired based on this website. However, I created the codes with a very different methodology to also include newer JavaScript methods like using classes and etc.

Travelling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithm This blog post is regarding using genetic algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem. In a one liner the TSP asks the following question: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of the cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?</description></item><item><title>Promise All</title><link>https://jianliew.me/blog/archive/2019-10/promiseall/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://jianliew.me/blog/archive/2019-10/promiseall/</guid><description>This post is a an entry to describe a use case when the Promise.all JavaScript method is needed. The official reference can be found here. This assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of how promises work.
Before we start, there is a need to understand how certain RESTful services are structured. For example, the Hacker News API has the end point called topstories. This end point however, does not contain any other information besides a list of item IDs.</description></item><item><title>k-Nearest Neighbour on Maps</title><link>https://jianliew.me/blog/archive/2019-10/nearestneighbour/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jianliew.me/blog/archive/2019-10/nearestneighbour/</guid><description>One of the most common query when working with maps is the nearest neighbour query. This post will explain how to accomplish an easy nearest neighbour query.
We will first start with a data set or coordinates.
The Nearest Neighbour Query on the map aims to return the nearest neighbour of a point. So, in the example, it can be seen that the 1st Nearest Neighbour of New York would be Boston and the 2nd Nearest Neighbour of New York Would be Chicago.</description></item><item><title>Java 13 on Ubuntu</title><link>https://jianliew.me/blog/archive/2019-10/java13/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2019 21:28:45 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://jianliew.me/blog/archive/2019-10/java13/</guid><description>Installing Java 13 on Ubuntu is pretty simple.
All that was needed was
sudo apt install openjdk-13-jdk sudo update-alternatives --config java Of course, it would be better if you are on the latest version of Ubuntu so that the apt actually finds it there. (I am currently using Ubuntu 19.04). You can obtain this information by
lsb_release -a After that, all that was needed was to properly configure the Java path where you can easily find where it is from doing</description></item><item><title>Voronoi Diagram</title><link>https://jianliew.me/blog/archive/2019-10/voronoi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2019 21:27:45 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://jianliew.me/blog/archive/2019-10/voronoi/</guid><description>One of the most common query when working with maps is the nearest neighbour query. This blog post will use Voronoi Diagrams to explain more regarding the nearest neighbour query.
Below is an example of a Voronoi diagram generated using d3.js. One of the good use case of a voronoi diagram in real life applications would be where would be finding a place to build emergency services. This place should have the most number of neighbouring regions.</description></item><item><title>Curriculum Vitae</title><link>https://jianliew.me/blog/cv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jianliew.me/blog/cv/</guid><description>Summary A passionate educator and technology lover with excellent programming and communication skills.
