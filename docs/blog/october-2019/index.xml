      <title>Sentiment Analysis</title>

      <description>Sentiment Analysis for the Sub-Reddit &amp;ldquo;HongKong&amp;rdquo; This post will perform sentiment analysis using AFINN. AFINN is a list of words rated for valence rated with an integer between minus five(negative) and plus five (positive). This implementation uses AFINN-en-165. 1
This approach however is a very naive approach as it does not build any models to determine the context of the usage of the word itself.

      <description>This post is a simple implementation of Genetic Algorithm GA. Here, you would start with a random string and end up with the target string.
 This post is heavily inspired based on this website. However, I created the codes with a very different methodology to also include newer JavaScript methods like using classes and etc.
